                <h3>About Dean</h3>
				<p>I've been in the business for a long time, since i was 16 and my basic rules consist of: Sticking to short, high-intensity sessions may be tempting when time is tight. But if you have specific goals in mind, carving out an hour to exercise brings with it fitness benefits that micro workouts just ca'nt replicate.

                    Even if gyms are closed, or you'd just rather work out at home, an hour gives you plenty of time for a well-rounded routine with a proper warm-up and cool down. You could do a full body workout, target specific areas or work on your cardiovascular endurance. Plus, having 60 minutes lets you build the intensity over the course of your workout session.
                                
                    Whether you're prepping for a triathlon or an obstacle race, regular one hour exercise sessions at the gym are an excellent step in the right direction. Longer sessions are perfect for honing specific techniques to get you over the finish line, letting you work on foot strike, breathing patterns, pedal rhythm or pull-ups, for example.
                                
                    But for maximum return on your time investment, having a solid workout plan in place is key. Pre-planning lets you move around the gym with purpose, without wasting precious time wondering what to do next.

            <h3>About Alex</h3>
			    <p>
                    When I first began my adventure with fitness I was anything but the picture of health. 
                    I was very overweight and I realized it was because of eating fast food and drinking pop and beer on a regular basis. 
                    I decided to do something about it. I immersed myself in a new lifestyle and have never regretted it.
                        
                    I did, however, have multiple ups and downs. It took me years to make a decision to thoroughly examine my workouts and make 
                    necessary changes.
                                    
                    Learning about the benefits of Metabolic Training and HIIT entirely transformed my body. 
                    What I enjoy the most about it is that there is minimal or even NO equipment required and you can do it anytime 
                    and anywhere.

                    an experience that makes them happy, confident, and strong. I realize how being overweight affects many aspects of 
                    your life, and I want to be there for you and help you discover the benefits and joys of training that helped me

            <h3>About Anika</h3>
				<p>
                    As a long time trainer and coach, I have dedicated my life to the development and improvement of athletes. I've been in business for over 15 years and have helped 
                    numerous athletes succeed at the world class level. Training is not a hobby or part time job to me. It is
                    my career and obsession.

                                         
                    Throughout my time as a trainer and coach, it has become clear that what works for one 
                    athlete may be entirely different from what works for another. Athletes are not robots or machines. Each
                    athlete has a unique engine with unique needs.
                                            
                    Successful training is all about finding what works for you. Thus, there will never be a do it my way or else, tone here, as such an approach goes against everything that I believe in. Instead, 
                    I'll strive to help you find your way by providing sound, real world tested and research supported advice
